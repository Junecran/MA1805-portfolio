# **Media**
 sketch uses microphone input (sound) to generate rain and lightning — a natural, emotional metaphor. can frame this as a reflection on how sound and emotion shape perception of the environment.

Integrate images or video that represent cultural associations with rain (renewal, melancholy, cleansing, climate change, etc.).

Use audio not just as input, but as meaningful content (e.g. spoken word, protest chants, rainfall sounds).

Reflect on how your visual choices reshape those cultural meanings — e.g., turning noise (chaos) into something beautiful and natural.
